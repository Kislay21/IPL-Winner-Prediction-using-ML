# IPL-Winner-Prediction-using-ML

Cricket prediction is an interesting domain for every Cricket Fanatics out there. So this is the combination of cricket plus data analysis that gives us the predictions for the new season of the IPL. 

The model was trained on previous IPL data. All the necessary steps are performed in order to train the model like Feature Engineering, Exploratory data Analysis, Model Building.
Various Machine learning Algorithms are applied on the training dataset which are:-
a) Logistic Regression
b) Naive-Bayes Classifier
c) KNN algorithm
d) Support Vector Classifier
e) Random Forest Classifier
f) Decision Trees Algorithm.

The Accuracies of the ML algorithms were compared and lastly the model was predicted on the test dataset.
